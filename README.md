In this repository you can find the final project of my master in software engineering.
## Introduction
While functional requirements specification with Behaviour-Driven Development has matured, 
defining non-functional requirements(NFRs) represents an open challenge due to the implicit 
complexity and ambiguity of quality attributes. Based on the feedback obtained in an enterprise 
context and literature review, this work proposes a framework that allows to define requirements 
for expressing non-functional constraints, in such a way that the functional tests can be reused. 
The framework is an instrument that guides teams in writing quantifiable NFRs from the early stage 
of a project. Furthermore, it provides an updated and automated overview of the fulfilment of NFRs.

If you want to find more information about the methodology you can read the thesis in the folder docs.
