TO DO:
-extend support for multiple terminal symbols definition with same expression, but derived from different non-terminal
-search a way to hide from the generated steps the TesterModuleMessenger, keeping it available for Aspectj
-improve lexical parameter passage (Pair)
-optimizing class, arguments and method passage through reflection with construnctors and using shared class instance
-optimize timing method in probabilistic testing suite
-manage exception handling
-fix "at least|at most" bug
- insert exception for multiple user defined method associated with statFormula

DONE:
-checked scalacheck
-added support for shared execution for differenet nonfunctional requirements
	-added iterationreport that keeps track of the execution time and exceptions of each iteration
	-decoupled stateFormula verification of externally defined method and scenario scope
-eliminated need for explicit declaration of dependency
