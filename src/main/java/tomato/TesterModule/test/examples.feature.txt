@test
Feature: Examples 
  A list of example scenario to test Tomato's capabilities

@quality
  Scenario: Execute quality testing
  	Given I want to do stuff and I insert 1.0
  	When other stuff happens and I insert "hello"
    Then [the probability of "something happening" after 0.2 is at most 0.5]
    And [the probability of "something else happening" after 0.9 is at most 0.5]
    
	Scenario: I don't execute quality testing
		Then don't do it

#Performance constraint
@quality
	Scenario: ATM testing
		Given the customer wants to withdraw
		When the card has been entered
		Then [the probability that "the client obtains the money" within time t is at least p]
		
#Reliability
	Scenario:
		Given an user
		When a shutdown occurs
		Then the system recovers automatically
		the probability of system recovery being completed in less than 3 is greater than 0.75;
		
#Availability
	Scenario:
	 Given the user wants to open 3 video streams
	 And the connectivity is weak
	 Then the QOS drops below minimum
	 Then there is a less than 10% chance of the QoS dropping below minimum within 3 seconds
		
#Security
	Scenario:
		Given a customer wants to login to the website
		When he enters the private zone
		And an hacker tries to identify the ip of the customer with an ip spoofing attack
		Then the system activates the protection
		Then the probability in which the sender’s IP is detected is less than p.
